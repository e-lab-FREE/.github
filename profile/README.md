## Framework for Remote Experiments in Education
FREE (Framework for Remote Experiments in Education) is a novel system, that, using modern technologies, architectures, and programming practices, allows the easy development and integration of remote experiments. These scientific experiments can be executed using a regular browser from any part of the internet and at any moment.

The architecture provides a loose coupling between the infrastructure (FREE server) and the remote experiments, thus facilitating the development and deployment of new experiments.
